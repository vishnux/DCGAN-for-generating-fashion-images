# DCGAN for generating fashion images

An adversarial approach is used to train two models simultaneously. A generator learns to produce realistic-looking images, but a discriminator learns to distinguish between authentic and artificial images. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) is used to generate fashionable clothes
